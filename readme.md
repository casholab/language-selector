# Casho Lab Language Selector Library

This is an open source language selector that fits EVERY language, allowing for optionality in how it is displayed.

Optionaity includes

- Modal vs Data List
- Flag vs Flags vs no flags
- Tiers for scripts and regionalities vs "flat" layout


Supported Frameworks
1. HTML/JS/CSS (default web standards)
2. React
3. Svelte

- only these will be supported, svelte as I belive its the best current framework, html as its most standard and portable, react as its most commonly used on new projects

Challenges for languages selectors
- What is the most globally recongizable icons for "language", "localization" and "country" 
- Do we display the names of the languages in the language itself (endonym), in english. 
- What if a lanaguage has multiple written scripts
- What if a language has multiple regions? 




We need to make a script that interprets the browser language settings and chooses the best language based on a a list of languages  which are supported.



# Data
We use cashO lab compiled list of langauges which follow iso standards for different codes, regions, and script standards.
